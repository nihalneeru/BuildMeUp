# BuildMeUp

## Description
As part of HackTX 2023, we created this application in response to Procore's proposed challenge: something to better the mental health of construction workers. This is by no means a professional product and is moreso an MVP. We built this website to practice our full-stack skills while gaining experience.

### Inspiration
The inspiration for the project stems from a genuine concern for the mental well-being of those in the construction industry, who often face challenging and demanding work environments.

### What it does
The app provides a virtual therapist specifically tailored for construction workers, offering personalized mental health support, guidance, and coping strategies to help them manage the unique challenges they face in their demanding work environments.

### How we built it
We built the app using React for the front end, ensuring a user-friendly interface, and integrated the powerful GPT API for advanced natural language processing capabilities. This combination allowed us to create an interactive and responsive virtual therapist experience, enabling personalized and empathetic mental health support for construction workers.

## What's Next?
We aim to expand the app's reach by partnering with construction companies and industry organizations to promote widespread adoption among workers. Additionally, we plan to conduct further research to enhance the AI model's understanding of industry-specific language and refine the platform's features based on user feedback. Our ultimate goal is to become a comprehensive mental health resource for the construction sector, advocating for a culture of well-being and resilience within the industry.
